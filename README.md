## General Information
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market.The company wants to know:
*Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
*How well those variables describe the price of a house.

## Conclusions
Based on my analysis of the available data and fetaures, we have created a stable model with regularization which explains how relevant independent features imapct the house prices. Kindly refer to the code to go through the analysis & conclusion.
